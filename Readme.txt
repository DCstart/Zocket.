Explanation of Approach
1. Understanding the Problem
The goal is to build a real-time task management system with:

User authentication (JWT-based)

Task creation, assignment, and tracking

AI-powered task suggestions (using OpenAI/Gemini API)

Real-time updates (WebSockets)

Deployment on cloud platforms (Vercel/Fly.io/Render)

Given the time constraint (4 hours), I focused on the core functionality:

User registration and login (JWT-based authentication)

Task creation and listing

A simple frontend to interact with the backend

2. Solution Design
Backend: Built with Golang using the Gin framework for REST API development. JWT is used for authentication, and tasks are stored in memory (for simplicity).

Frontend: Built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS for a simple UI. The frontend fetches tasks from the backend and allows users to create new tasks.

AI Integration: Due to time constraints, AI-powered task suggestions were not implemented, but the backend is ready to integrate with OpenAI/Gemini API for task breakdowns.

Real-time Updates: WebSockets were not implemented due to time constraints, but the backend is structured to support them using Goroutines.

3. Challenges
Time Management: With only 4 hours, I prioritized core features like authentication, task creation, and a simple frontend.

AI Integration: While the backend is ready for AI integration, implementing AI-powered task suggestions would require more time.

Real-time Updates: WebSockets were skipped due to time constraints, but the backend is designed to support them.

4. Deployment
The backend can be deployed on Render or Fly.io, and the frontend can be deployed on Vercel. For simplicity, I ran both locally during development.

Future Improvements
AI Integration: Integrate OpenAI/Gemini API for task suggestions and smart task breakdowns.

Real-time Updates: Implement WebSockets for real-time task updates.

Database: Replace in-memory storage with PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

Task Assignment: Add functionality to assign tasks to specific users.

Docker & Kubernetes: Containerize the application for easier deployment.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the ability to quickly build a functional full-stack application under tight time constraints. While some features like AI integration and real-time updates were not implemented, the core functionality is solid and ready for expansion. The use of AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT could further accelerate development in future iterations.
